 * @brief Fills holes in an image using a weighted average of boundary pixels.

 * 1. Looks at every boundary pixel in the entire image
 * 2. Calculates a weight for each boundary pixel based on its distance from the hole pixel
 * 3. Takes a weighted average of all boundary pixels' values, where:
 *    - Closer boundary pixels get higher weights
 *    - Further boundary pixels get lower weights
 *
 * This is the full version that considers all boundary pixels in the image,
 * making it more accurate but slower than the approximate version.
 *
 * @param image Pointer to the image data as a flat array of floats, linear values. Negative values indicate holes.
 * @param width Width of the image in pixels
 * @param height Height of the image in pixels
 * @param weightFunc Function that calculates the weight between two pixels based on their coordinates.
 *                   The weight should be higher for closer pixels and lower for distant pixels.
 *
 * @note The image is modified in-place. Hole pixels (negative values) are replaced with

 * 1. Processes pixels in order of their distance from the boundary
 * 2. For each pixel, takes the average of its 8-connected non-hole neighbors
 * 3. Once a pixel is filled, its value is used for filling subsequent pixels
 *
 * This version uses a queue-based approach to ensure each pixel is processed exactly once,
 * making it O(h) time complexity where h is the number of hole pixels. It uses 8-connected
 * neighborhood for better quality results.

/**
 * @brief Fills holes in an image using a KD-tree for efficient k-nearest neighbor search.
 *
 * This function implements an exact hole-filling algorithm that uses a KD-tree to efficiently
 * find the k-nearest boundary pixels for each hole pixel. The algorithm works as follows:
 * 1. Identifies all hole pixels (pixels with negative values) and boundary pixels
 * 2. Builds a KD-tree from the boundary pixels for efficient spatial queries
 * 3. For each hole pixel:
 *    - Uses the KD-tree to find its k-nearest boundary pixels, where k is nearestNeighborMax
 *    - Uses the provided weight function to calculate weights between pixels
 *    - Takes a weighted average of the found boundary pixels' values
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n * log m) where:
 * - n is the number of hole pixels
 * - m is the number of boundary pixels
 * - The KD-tree provides O(log m) nearest neighbor queries
 * In worst case (when m â‰ˆ n), this becomes O(n * log n)
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(m) for storing the KD-tree and boundary pixels
 *
 * This version combines the accuracy of considering the k-nearest boundary pixels with
 * the efficiency of spatial indexing. It's faster than the full version for large images
 * while maintaining good accuracy by focusing on the most relevant boundary pixels.
 *
 * @param image Pointer to the image data as a flat array of floats, linear values. Negative values indicate holes.
 * @param width Width of the image in pixels
 * @param height Height of the image in pixels
 * @param weightFunc Function that calculates the weight between two pixels based on their coordinates.
 *                   The weight should be higher for closer pixels and lower for distant pixels.
 * @param nearestNeighborMax Maximum number of nearest boundary pixels to consider for each hole pixel.
 *                          This parameter controls the trade-off between accuracy and performance.
 *                          A larger value will consider more boundary pixels but increase computation time.
 *
 * @note The image is modified in-place. Hole pixels are replaced with the weighted average
 *       of their k-nearest boundary pixels. The algorithm uses nanoflann's KD-tree implementation
 *       for efficient nearest neighbor search.
